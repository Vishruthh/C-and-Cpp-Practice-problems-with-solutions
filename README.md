# C or C++ Practice problems with solutions for beginners
This repo. contains all the practice questions that I've solved while I was learning C and C++. These are simple C.S. lab-level questions designed to test your skills. This repo. can be useful for beginner and intermediate-level C or C++ programmers. I have just uploaded the code along with questions. For the ones that I felt a detailed explanation was necessary, I have given it in my <a href="https://vishruthcodes.blogspot.com/">blog</a>. You can check that if you want. For the rest, the code is self-explanatory. <br>The C or C++ programs are easily inter-convertible by replacing the printf/scanf with cout/cin and vice versa and such, it shouldn't be much difficult to convert.</br>This repository will be regularly updated to include new problems I've solved or errors that I've resolved.</br>
If you felt the repository was useful, do star the repo, and give a follow. It would mean a lot to me.<br>

If you have any questions, doubts related to the code  do mention them <a href="https://vishruthcodes.blogspot.com/p/contact-us.html">here(blog) </a> or in <a href="https://github.com/Vishruthh/C-and-Cpp-Practice-problems-with-solutions/discussions/1"> github discussions</a>.

ðŸ’¡ Note: âœ… Button indicates that I have given a detailed explanation for the program in my <a href="https://vishruthcodes.blogspot.com/">blog</a>.
